# Fast-r-cnn-pedestrian-detection-with-CAFFE-and-GPU-support

C++ and Python2.7 implementation of a automatic system for pedestrian detection at night using far infrared visual information based on convolutional neural networks.

## Getting Started

The ProgramaTesis folder contains the implementation of the system in python 2.7 and the ProgramasTesisGPU/ProgramaTesisC++/ folder contains the implementation of the system in C ++ with GPU support.

To run the system you need to run either the file https://github.com/lmbarr/Fast-r-cnn-pedestrian-detection-with-CAFFE-and-GPU-support/blob/master/ProgramaTesis/ejecutar.py for python or the file https://github.com/lmbarr/Fast-r-cnn-pedestrian-detection-with-CAFFE-and-GPU-support/blob/master/ProgramasTesisGPU/ProgramaTesisC%2B%2B/main_videos.cpp for c++.

### Prerequisites

The software was executed on:
* Ubuntu 14.04

using:
* opencv and opencv_contrib 3.1.0 http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/22/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-ubuntu/
* caffe-fast https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn
* gcc 4.8.5
* python2 2.7.6
